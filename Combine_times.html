    <h1>Time Combination Calculator</h1>
    <h3>Applications of rational expressions was first created by Henri Pade in 1890, and to this day we have been using this to model specific rational functions. Rational<br>
        equations can be used to solve several different kinds of problems, such as work related problems, where two people or machines work together at different reates <br>
        to complete a task.</h3>
    <p>Please enter two times</p>
    <input id="time1" type="text" placeholder="Enter the first time:">
    <input id="time2" type="text" placeholder="Enter the second time:">

    <h4><br> Ex. <br> <br>
         Cathrine can paint a house in 15 hours. Dan can paint it in 30 hours. How long will it take them working together? 
        </h4>
    <p>In this example, we would just simply plug the values 15 and 30 into the boxes, and we have our answer<br></p>



   <h4><br>One inlet pipe can fill a pool in 8 hours. And a drain can empty the pool in 12 hours. How long will it take the pipe to fill the pool if the drain is left open?</h4>
        </h4>
    <p>In this example, we have a positive and a negative value. The 8 hours fill up, while the 12 drain it. So your two values here would be 8 and -12<br></p>
